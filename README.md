## Description:
1. Displays a counter that starts at 0.
2. It has two buttons: one to increment the counter and one to decrement it.
3. The counter cannot go above 10 or below 0. If it is at 10, the increment button must be disabled, and the same for the decrement button if the counter is at 0.
4. (Optional) Add a "Reset" button to return the counter to 0.


### Requirements:
* Use useState to manage the state of the counter.
* Control the state of the buttons (enabled/disabled) based on the value of the counter.
* Dynamically render the buttons based on the value of the counter.
* Create unit testing for All their functions.
